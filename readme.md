# Project Proposal

1. Roughly, what will your drawing look like

2. What are two variables you could use so that when you change each variable, the drawing changes?

   size of a soccer ball and size of a hexagon


4. Where is there repetition in your drawing?
   
   The small little black hexagons on the lines along the soccer ball


7. What are the main parts of your drawing? Are there clear sections or objects?

   The main parts are the heaxgons of the soccer ball. It adds the detail and the main parts of the ball.


8. How could you use a loop variable of a for loop? Is there somewhere in your drawing where something is repeated, but it's slightly different each time? Maybe the same object is repeated in different places, or maybe a similar object is repeated but with different sizes?

   I can use a loop on making lines along the soccer ball. As you can see on the soccer ball there are small little white lines that connect to each other
